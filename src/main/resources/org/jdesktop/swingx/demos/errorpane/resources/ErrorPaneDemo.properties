warningtitle=Warning Dialog Example
warningtext=<html><P><font color=black>This is a test of the <font color=red><b>Emergency Broadcast System</b></font>. <i><b>This is <br> only a test</b></i>.  The webmaster of your local intranet, in voluntary <br> cooperation with the <font color=blue><b>Federal</b></font> and <font color=blue><b>State</b></font> authorities, have <br> developed this system to keep you informed in the event of an <br> emergency. If this had been an actual emergency, the signal you <br> just heard would have been followed by official information, news <br> or instructions. This concludes this test of the <font color=red><b>Emergency <br> Broadcast System</b></font>.</font></P><P><br>Developer Note: This dialog demo used HTML for text formatting.</P></html>
